                    <h3>How I Won a Writing Scholarship by Writing About My Distaste for Writing Scholarship Essays</h3>


                    <p> Some of my best work has been written in anger. I tell myself I don't have time to be angry in my daily life. I try to keep a level head even in an argument. Being logical and calculated has always been the better decision for me. And I don't mean to say I'm a pushover, because people seem to think that when you tell them you're not angry much. I'm just out here with my values trying to be a good person, to protect the people I love, and do what feels right to me. But do I have to be angry? Yes. I do. I make this anger a controlled burn. I surround myself with my friends like rocks around a fire and talk it through. I'm a writer. I write. </p>
                   <p> I tell myself I'm not angry anymore when I still am. I hear something I don't agree with, but I turn in over in my hands until it's hot. I wait for the words to come. This is my own way of processing the world. I want to hear what is said, but I won't be quiet long.<br /><br />
                    In high school and going into undergrad I was angry a lot. I managed my way through childhood, but I was still working out some of the kinks. I didn't always feel the support of my friends and my family, because I was turned inward. It was during this time that I had to learn how to navigate confrontation. </p>
                   <p> One of these things that I didn't agree with was the slew writing prompts for scholarship essays that my teachers kept piling on. I got to work writing a pile of essays. Sometimes I was asked to read another student's essay and offer suggestions. I had a building feeling that the whole thing was bullshit. All of it. Everyone was writing the same thing. Everyone wrote what we all felt we needed to be said to be heard. We wrote what we felt someone wanted to hear. That's when I wrote the poem below, "An Honest Scholarship Essay." I was angry and in that anger I decided to try to portray the experience I was having simultaneously with those around me who were having the same experience. I intertwined our mirrored stories. Looking back at it now, it's just another teenage poem. I've grown so much as a writer, but this was a time in my life when I learned to push back, to question, to always wonder why and stick to what feels right to me and not what I think someone else wants. I finally feel like I'm channeling this same style that feels authentic into the writing I'm doing now. If you're reading this I hope you remember one of those moments where you felt alive, when you felt like you screamed at the edge of the universe and someone heard.</p> <br />

                    An Honest Scholarship Essay <i>from An Oak, A Joke (2010)</i> <br /><br />

                    It's approaching the end of my senior year<br />
                    and I'm staring blankly at my fifth empty sheet of paper<br />
                    trying to transition from a Holocaust Remembrance prompt<br />
                    to an essay to an alliance organization<br />
                    where go I from being an only child trying to pursue<br />

                    her dead grandmothers broken dream<br />
                    to a desperate, isolated teen in the deep south<br />
                    with a different sexual preference.<br />
                    These are two of the more interesting topics among the piles of prompts<br />
                    politely asking me, "What makes you think you deserve this?"<br /><br />

                    I type my first paragraph about how<br />
                    I'm a citizen driven<br />
                    by the calling of a middle-class<br />
                    life where I might scrounge at the bottom,<br />
                    making a living off a minimum wage salary<br />
                    from wiping the noses of elementary kids<br />
                    whose parents have five thousand dollars to drop in the hands of some high school kid<br />
                    saying all the right things the right way<br />
                    about how they'd be angels,<br />
                    if you'd only buy their wings.<br />
                    When really, we just want to fly through life<br />
                    and one in four freshmen drop out of college.<br /><br />

                    While I'm writing I don't mention any of this,<br />
                    but instead I try to sound modest like I'm some perfect kid writing this even though<br />
                    I know I don't deserve it more<br />
                    than any delinquents,<br />
                    because I know no one wants to hear,<br />
                    "Hey, I'm a seventeen-year-old female poet with a 3.8 grade point average and an average existence. I drag myself out of bed in the morning and hardly ever eat a healthy<br />
                    breakfast. I know there are plenty of other kids who deserve this scholarship but I swear to god if I get this I'll get through college with an 89.5% and if I don't I'm lucky to be making minimum wage or live through my parents nagging, who similarly were never very good at faking essays. That, my number one ambition is to be happy, and what makes me happy is writing poetry that won't mean anything to the majority of people but means everything to me."<br /><br />

                    I want to say all this, but I don't,
                    because the truth is,
                    the truth doesn't win scholarships.
